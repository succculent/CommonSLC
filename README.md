# COMMON SLC
This is the repo for Common Productions SLC. This will feature our work and act as a homepage with information and links. Site published at commonslc.com

### Updates
I decided to significantly simplify this page to begin with. We need a functional and professional copy within a couple days so I am developing the whole page in a single HTML file instead of dealing with webpack. This will also force me to simplify the features and graphics that can be on the page. I was previously working to create something very interactive and audio reactive, but without a mixcloud API and some way to legally access the music I don't think we should be using it for a professional consumer facing page.

### TODO
- Basic Information
- Mobile CSS
- Web CSS
- Simple Canvas or WebGL backdrop
- Simple mouseMove reactivity
- Simple tap reactivity for mobile
