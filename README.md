# COMMON SLC
This is the repo for Common Collective SLC. This will feature our work and act as a homepage with information and links. Site published at commonslc.com

### Updates
I decided to significantly simplify this page. Redeveloped the whole page in a single HTML file instead of dealing with a bundler (webpack). Includes links to twitter and instagram. Includes a title and an about (popup with some neat effects). Finally, there is space in the middle of the page to just embed a PNG of the poster for the current/upcoming event. I think this simplifies the page and makes it suuuuper easy to maintain. Hopefully I can add some flair with particle effects and mouse/tap effects.

### TODO
- particle effect for #about
- tap / mouse effects for fun
- dark mode (read users current mode)
